      <h2>Why choosing a career feels confusing in India</h2>

      <p>
        Most students are shown only a few “safe” or socially accepted options.
        Rare but valid paths are ignored. Decisions are often driven by pressure,
        fear, or incomplete information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Course outcomes, competition levels, effort required,
        and long-term realities are rarely explained honestly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Career decisions should not be guesswork.
        They should be informed.
      </p>

      <h2>How MyCareerTree is different</h2>

      <p><strong>Tree-based thinking</strong><br>
        Careers are connected. One choice leads to many future paths.
        We show the full structure — not isolated options.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Complete transparency</strong><br>
        Popular, unpopular, rare, risky — all valid paths are shown honestly.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Reality over hype</strong><br>
        Every path includes effort, competition, and long-term reality —
        not fake motivation or guaranteed success.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Indian education first</strong><br>
        Designed strictly around how the Indian education
        and examination system actually works.

  <!-- HOW TREE WORKS -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>How the Career Tree works</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Start from your current stage (usually Class 10)</li>
        <li>Choose a branch — Science, Commerce, Arts, Diploma, ITI, etc.</li>
        <li>Explore what each choice realistically leads to</li>
        <li>Move forward step by step, without blind backtracking</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You never need to “go back” randomly.
        Every step is connected forward.

  <!-- VISION -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Built for clarity, not shortcuts</h2>

      <p>
        MyCareerTree is not a coaching platform,
        ranking list, or shortcut guide.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a growing knowledge system designed to help students
        think clearly, realistically, and independently about their future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deeper visual trees, tools, and research-based projects
        will be added over time.
