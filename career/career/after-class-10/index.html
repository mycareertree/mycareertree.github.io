      <h2>Why This Stage Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Until Class 10, students in India follow almost the same academic path.
        After that, multiple routes open up — academic, technical, vocational,
        and alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing without understanding all options often leads to regret later.
        MyCareerTree shows every possible route honestly so you can decide wisely.
