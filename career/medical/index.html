  <!-- WHAT IS MEDICAL -->

      <h2>What Does a Medical Career Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        A medical career involves diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases,
        as well as improving human health.
      </p>
      <p>
        In India, most medical careers begin with clearing
        <strong>NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)</strong>.

  <!-- REALITY CHECK -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Reality Check (Must Read)</h2>
      <p>
        Becoming a doctor takes many years — MBBS alone takes 5.5 years,
        and specialization can take another 3–6 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Government seats are limited, private colleges are expensive,
        and competition is extremely high.
      </p>
      <p>
        Medical is not a “quick success” career.
        It rewards patience and dedication over time.
