      <h2>How MyCareerTree Works</h2>
      <p>
        In India, most students are shown only a few popular options.
        MyCareerTree is different.
      </p>
      <p>
        We start from a single point — <strong>Class 10</strong> —
        and show every valid path forward: science, commerce, arts, diploma,
        ITI, vocational routes, defence paths, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each option is connected, explained honestly, and marked with reality
        indicators so you can decide with clarity.
