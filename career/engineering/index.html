      <p>
        Engineering is one of the most chosen careers in India.
        It offers technical knowledge, problem-solving skills,
        and access to diverse industries — but it is also highly competitive.

      <h2>What Is Engineering?</h2>
      <p>
        Engineering is the application of science, mathematics, and technology
        to solve real-world problems. Engineers design, build, analyze,
        and improve systems, machines, software, and infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In India, engineering is usually pursued as a
        <strong>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)</strong> or
        <strong>Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)</strong> degree.

  <!-- REALITY CHECK -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Reality Check (Must Read)</h2>
      <p>
        Engineering does not guarantee a high-paying job.
        College quality, skills, internships, and continuous learning
        matter more than the degree alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many engineers shift careers due to lack of interest or skill mismatch.
        This is normal — and alternative paths exist.
