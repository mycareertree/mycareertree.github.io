      <h2>Reality Check (Very Important)</h2>
      <p>
        Arts is often chosen by students who are told they are “weak”.
        This is incorrect and harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Careers like law, civil services, and academia are extremely competitive
        and demand strong discipline, reading habits, and critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arts offers freedom and depth — but success requires seriousness and effort.
