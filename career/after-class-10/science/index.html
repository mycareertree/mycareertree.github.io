      <h1>Science After Class 10</h1>
      <p>
        Science is the most popular — and the most demanding — stream after Class 10 in India.
        It opens doors to engineering, medical, defence, research, and more,
        but it also comes with pressure and competition.

  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>What Does Choosing Science Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        Students who choose Science in Classes 11–12 study Physics and Chemistry
        along with Mathematics and/or Biology.
      </p>
      <p>
        This stream is suitable for students who are comfortable with concepts,
        problem-solving, and continuous academic effort.

  <!-- SUBJECT COMBINATIONS -->

      <h2>Science Subject Combinations</h2>
      <p>
        Science is not a single path. It has multiple combinations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>PCM</strong> – Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics</li>
        <li><strong>PCB</strong> – Physics, Chemistry, Biology</li>
        <li><strong>PCMB</strong> – Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology</li>
      </ul>

        Choosing Science does not mean only doctor or engineer.
        Below are the major directions students take:

  <!-- REALITY CHECK -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Reality Check (Must Read)</h2>
      <p>
        Science is not for everyone. Competition is high, entrance exams are tough,
        and success requires consistent effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many students choose Science due to family pressure without understanding
        their interest or aptitude. This often leads to stress and dropouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Science does not work out, alternative paths still exist — and MyCareerTree
        will show them clearly at every stage.
